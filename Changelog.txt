July 4th, 2016 (Version 1.0.6)
 - Added many tests, but coverage is still far from 100%
 - Automated creation of a NuGet package under 'Deploy' build configuration
 - Constructors ctor(byte[] data) and ctor(byte[] data, int length) were
   merged into one ctor(IList<byte> data, int length, int offset)
 - Fixed a bug in bitCount() where it return '0' for BigInteger(0),
   now returns '1'

April 6, 2015 (Version 1.0.4)
 - Fixed some well-known bugs
 - Created a NuGet package (available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/BigInteger/)

September 23, 2002 (Version 1.03)
 - Fixed operator- to give correct data length.
 - Added Lucas sequence generation.
 - Added Strong Lucas Primality test.
 - Added integer square root method.
 - Added setBit/unsetBit methods.
 - New isProbablePrime() method which do not require the
   confident parameter.

August 29, 2002 (Version 1.02)
 - Fixed bug in the exponentiation of negative numbers.
 - Faster modular exponentiation using Barrett reduction.
 - Added getBytes() method.

 - Added overloading of ^ operator.
 - Faster computation of Jacobi symbol.

August 19, 2002 (Version 1.01)
 - Big integer is stored and manipulated as unsigned integers (4 bytes) instead of
   individual bytes this gives significant performance improvement.
 - Updated Fermat's Little Theorem test to use a^(p-1) mod p = 1
 - Added isProbablePrime method.
 - Updated documentation.

August 9, 2002 (Version 1.0)
 - Initial Release.
